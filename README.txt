This is the README for HW1.

  My Jupyter notebook reads in data from the Data directory.
  It performs simple operations to add columns to the dataframe.
  It then copies the subset of 2016 data into a new dataframe.
  Using the new dataframe of 2016 data, it plots the counts of rides per hour in 24 hour time.
  I then determine what the busiest hour of the day was in 2016 (on average).
